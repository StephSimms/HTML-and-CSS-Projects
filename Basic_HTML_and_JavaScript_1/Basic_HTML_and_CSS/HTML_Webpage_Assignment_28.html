    <p>Imagine there's no Heaven<br>
        It's easy if you try<br>
        No Hell below us<br>
        Above us only sky<br>
        Imagine all the people livin' for today<br>
        Ah, ah, ah-ah<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Imagine there's no countries<br>
        It isn't hard to do<br>
        Nothin' to kill or die for<br>
        And no regligion, too<br>
        Imagine all the people livin' life in peace<br>
        Yoo, hoo, oo-oo</br>
